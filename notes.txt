Code running quicker for serial - reporting less memory for parallel but this could be wrong

Fetch command - how do we have groups of remote references?

Is fourier best/easiest example to implement, perhaps prefix sum as we have comparison code already

References are available everywhere it seems,so long as you use fetch, however it is not practical to set a variable name for each of the references we would need.


I still don't understand how I should go about parallelising my fourier code aside from the obvious placing of parallel directives around the odd and even splits

explanations I've found online are written for mathematicians and involve stupid grey box diagrams that no one can understand.
